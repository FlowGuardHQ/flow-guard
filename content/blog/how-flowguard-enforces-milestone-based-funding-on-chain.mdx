# How FlowGuard Enforces Milestone-Based Funding On-Chain

## Introduction

Grant programs and project funding often follow one of two models:

- Send all funds upfront and hope milestones are met.
- Keep funds in a shared wallet and manually release them.

Both approaches introduce risk.

Upfront funding exposes capital to misuse.

Manual milestone releases depend on:

- Someone remembering to execute payouts
- Someone having custody
- Someone deciding whether a milestone is complete

FlowGuard introduces milestone-based funding enforced directly by covenant contracts on Bitcoin Cash.

## The Core Idea

A budget plan defines:

- Total allocation
- Number of milestones
- Unlock timestamps
- Amount per milestone

Funds are locked inside a contract.

They cannot be released early.

They cannot exceed milestone amounts.

They cannot bypass the schedule.

The blockchain enforces the release logic.

## How It Works

FlowGuard budget plans are built using step-based vesting logic.

Each milestone represents:

- A timestamp
- A specific unlock amount

The contract verifies:

- Has the required timestamp passed?
- Has this milestone already been released?
- Is the release amount within the defined allocation?

If the conditions are not met, the transaction fails.

There is no override.

## Example Scenario

Imagine a BCH development grant:

- Total: 12 BCH
- Duration: 6 months
- 2 BCH unlocked per month

The budget contract enforces:

- Month 1 → 2 BCH unlockable
- Month 2 → 2 BCH unlockable
- Month 3 → 2 BCH unlockable

If someone attempts to release 4 BCH in Month 1, the contract rejects it.

If someone tries to release Month 4 funds early, the contract rejects it.

Milestone enforcement is part of the script.

## Why This Matters

Milestone-based funding reduces:

- Capital misuse risk
- Disputes over release timing
- Dependency on a single treasury operator
- Informal enforcement

It introduces predictability.

Both funders and recipients know:

- Exactly when funds unlock
- Exactly how much unlocks
- Exactly what the schedule enforces

## Optional Pause and Control

Budget plans can include pause logic.

This allows:

- Temporary halting of future releases
- Controlled continuation once resolved

Even this logic is defined inside the contract.

Not in a backend toggle.

## Difference From Manual Escrow

**Traditional escrow:**

A person or service holds funds.

They decide when to release.

**FlowGuard escrow:**

The contract holds funds.

Time and rules decide when to release.

This removes subjective discretion from the release mechanism.

## BCH-Specific Advantage

Because Bitcoin Cash supports covenant logic and deterministic script validation, budget enforcement becomes:

- Trust-minimized
- Transparent
- Publicly verifiable

Anyone can inspect:

- Contract address
- Unlock schedule
- Release history

No hidden ledger entries.

## Who Benefits

Budget plans are useful for:

- BCH ecosystem grants
- Contributor-based funding
- Hackathon prize vesting
- DAO development roadmaps
- Long-term protocol research funding

Instead of hoping milestones are respected, they become enforceable.

## Risk Reduction

Budget contracts prevent:

- Early capital extraction
- Over-release
- Informal milestone bypass
- Hidden payout acceleration

Funds only move when the script allows it.

## Closing

Milestone funding should not depend on memory or good faith.

It should depend on enforceable logic.

FlowGuard budget plans move grant structure directly onto Bitcoin Cash.

Time unlocks funds.

The contract verifies conditions.

The blockchain enforces release.
