# What FlowGuard Actually Is (And What It Isn’t)

## Introduction

In the previous post, we discussed the problem:

**Most BCH teams manage treasury with shared wallets and informal rules.**

Today, we answer a simpler question:

**What exactly is FlowGuard?**

FlowGuard is an on-chain treasury management system built on Bitcoin Cash.

- It is **not** a wallet.
- It is **not** a custodial service.
- It is **not** a database pretending to be on-chain.

It is a set of **covenant contracts** that enforce treasury rules directly on the blockchain.

## The Core Modules

FlowGuard is composed of six primary modules.

Each one addresses a real treasury use case inside the BCH ecosystem.

### 1. Multisignature Vaults

Vaults are programmable treasuries.

They enforce:

- M-of-N approval thresholds
- Per-cycle spending caps
- Time-based unlock windows
- Optional recipient restrictions

Signers must approve transactions — but approval alone is not enough.

The contract still verifies:

- Is this within the allowed cap?
- Has the current cycle unlocked?
- Does this payout violate treasury policy?

The rules are encoded in the contract itself.

### 2. Vesting Streams

Streams handle structured payments over time.

Examples:

- Contributor salaries
- Team token vesting
- Grant distributions

State is tracked using CashTokens NFT commitments.

Each stream stores:

- Current status
- Total released
- Time cursor
- Recipient identity

When a claim occurs, the NFT commitment updates.

The contract calculates what is vested.
The chain enforces the release.

### 3. Recurring Payments

Recurring payments allow fixed-interval releases:

- Daily
- Weekly
- Monthly

Instead of manually sending payroll each period, the contract enforces:

- Interval timing
- Release amounts
- Remaining balance

No one needs to “remember” to execute payments.

### 4. Merkle Airdrops

FlowGuard supports structured distribution using:

- A Merkle root embedded in the contract
- Proof-based claiming
- On-chain double-claim prevention

Recipients submit cryptographic proof.

The contract verifies eligibility.

No manual distribution required.

### 5. Governance Voting

Governance is handled with:

- Token locking
- Vote recording
- Tally commitments

Votes are tied to locked tokens.

The contract enforces:

- Voting period
- Eligibility
- Execution rules

There is no hidden counting process off-chain.

### 6. Budget Plans

Budget plans support milestone-based funding.

Instead of releasing full funding upfront:

- Funds unlock in steps
- Milestones are enforced
- Releases follow schedule rules

This reduces risk in grant programs and development funding.

## What FlowGuard Is Not

It’s important to be precise.

FlowGuard is **not**:

- A custodial treasury manager
- A centralized execution engine
- A backend-controlled wallet

The backend improves UX and indexing.

It does not control funds.

All treasury policies are enforced by covenant logic on Bitcoin Cash.

**If a rule fails, the transaction fails on-chain.**

## Why This Matters for the BCH Ecosystem

Bitcoin Cash already enables:

- Peer-to-peer payments
- Fast settlement
- Low fees

FlowGuard extends BCH into:

- DAO infrastructure
- Grant distribution systems
- Structured treasury control
- On-chain organizational coordination

It allows BCH to support not just transactions — but governance and capital management.

That is a meaningful expansion of capability.

## The Design Philosophy

FlowGuard follows three principles:

### Non-custodial
Users sign transactions in their own wallets.

### On-chain enforcement
Treasury rules live inside covenant contracts.

### Minimal trust
No hidden admin keys.
No override switches.

If it isn’t enforced by script, it isn’t considered a rule.

## Closing

FlowGuard is not trying to replace wallets.

It’s trying to move treasury logic from conversations to code.

In the next post, we’ll break down how FlowGuard remains non-custodial — and why that matters for real BCH teams managing real capital.

If you’re building on Bitcoin Cash and managing treasury, this is infrastructure worth understanding.
