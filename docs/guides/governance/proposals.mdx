Governance proposals let vault members request treasury payouts or signal intent on a decision. The full on-chain flow involves deploying a ProposalCovenant, collecting 2-of-3 signer approvals, and executing the payout.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the vault">
    Navigate to **Vaults → [your vault] → Governance → New Proposal**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fill in the proposal">
    - **Title** — concise label (e.g. "Q1 Contractor Payout — Alice")
    - **Description** — rationale, deliverables, any supporting info
    - **Recipient** — BCH address that will receive the funds
    - **Amount** — BCH amount requested
    - **Quorum** — minimum total vote weight (for token-weighted governance proposals)
    - **Voting duration** — days the voting window is open (default 7)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit off-chain">
    Click **Create Proposal**. This creates the database record with `status: pending`. No on-chain transaction yet.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create on-chain proposal">
    Click **Fund Proposal On-chain**. The app calls `POST /api/proposals/:id/create-onchain`, which deploys the ProposalCovenant and returns a `wcTransaction`. Sign it in your wallet to lock the proposal's payout amount in the covenant.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">
    After the wallet broadcasts, the app calls `POST /api/proposals/:id/confirm-create`. The proposal status becomes `pending` and signers are notified.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Approval Flow

Each of the 3 vault signers individually approves the proposal by calling `POST /api/proposals/:id/approve-onchain` (or clicking **Approve** in the UI). When 2 of 3 sign, the proposal moves to `approved` and is ready for execution.

See [Voting on Proposals](/guides/governance/voting) for the approval and execution guide.
