When you lock tokens to vote on a governance proposal, those tokens are held in a VoteLockCovenant until the voting period ends. After the period closes, you can reclaim them.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Wait for voting to close">
    The proposal detail page shows the voting deadline. Tokens cannot be unlocked while the vote is still open — the covenant enforces this with `tx.locktime >= votingPeriodEnd`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open the proposal">
    Navigate to **Governance → [proposal]** and find your vote entry in the vote list.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Unlock tokens">
    Click **Unlock Tokens**. The app calls `POST /api/governance/:proposalId/unlock` with your address. The backend reads your stored `contract_address`, `constructor_params`, and `nft_commitment` from when you confirmed the lock.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sign">
    Your wallet displays the unlock transaction. Sign it — this returns your CashTokens to your address.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">
    The app calls `POST /api/governance/:proposalId/confirm-unlock` with the `txHash`. The backend verifies your address received the tokens and marks the unlock complete.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What if the Contract Data is Missing?

If you voted using the off-chain vote endpoint (without locking on-chain), there is no VoteLockCovenant to unlock — no tokens were ever locked. Only votes submitted via `POST /governance/:id/lock` and `confirm-lock` lock actual tokens.

## Lost Vote Record

The vote record is stored in `governance_votes` linked to your `voterAddress` and the `proposalId`. If the record is missing `contract_address` (e.g. the lock was never confirmed), the unlock endpoint returns `400: Vote lock contract data not recorded`. Contact the FlowGuard team to resolve manually.
