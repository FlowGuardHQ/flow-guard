<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Rewards">
    Go to **Rewards → Issue Reward**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the reward">
    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | Recipient | BCH P2PKH address |
    | Amount | BCH or token amount |
    | Token | BCH or CashToken (provide `tokenCategory`) |
    | Release after | `0` for immediate, or future Unix timestamp |
    | Vault | Funding source vault (optional) |
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy and fund">
    Click **Issue Reward**. For immediate rewards (`release after: 0`), the backend creates an open airdrop with `amountPerClaim` set to the reward amount and the recipient's address in the merkle tree. For deferred rewards, it creates a single-milestone budget plan.

    Sign the funding `wcTransaction` in your wallet.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">
    After broadcasting, confirm the transaction. The reward appears in the recipient's dashboard immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Immediate vs. Deferred

- **Immediate**: recipient can claim the moment the funding transaction is confirmed on-chain
- **Deferred**: the covenant enforces a time lock; the recipient can claim after `releaseAfter` seconds have elapsed since funding
