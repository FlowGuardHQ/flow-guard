<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Bounties">
    Go to **Bounties → New Bounty**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the bounty">
    - **Title** — the task or deliverable
    - **Recipient** — BCH address of the builder who will complete the work
    - **Vault** — funding source (the vault's controller signs the covenant)
    - **Amount** — total payout in BCH or tokens
    - **Lock duration** — seconds from funding until the recipient can claim (e.g. `2592000` for 30 days)
    - **Cancelable** — whether the funder can cancel before the recipient claims
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy and fund">
    Click **Create Bounty**. The backend creates a single-milestone budget plan and returns the funding `wcTransaction`. Sign it in your wallet and confirm.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Notify the recipient">
    Share the bounty detail URL with the builder. They see the locked amount, the unlock date, and a countdown.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Claim Flow (Recipient)

When the lock duration elapses:

1. The builder opens the bounty and clicks **Claim Bounty**
2. The app checks that `current_time >= startTime + lockDuration`
3. The claim `wcTransaction` is returned for the builder to sign
4. After broadcasting, `confirm-release` is called and the funds arrive in the builder's wallet

## Cancellation

If `cancelable: true`, the funder can cancel the bounty at any time before the recipient claims. Funds return to the vault controller's address. After cancellation the bounty is permanently closed.
