Vaults are the on-chain treasury containers for all FlowGuard products. All streams, payments, airdrops, grants, and governance tokens can be linked to a vault, making it easy to manage organizational budgets from a single address.

## Creating a Vault

Navigate to **Vaults → Create Vault**:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Name | Human-readable label |
| Signer 1, 2, 3 | BCH addresses of the three vault signers |
| Signer pubkeys | 33-byte compressed public keys for the CashScript 2-of-3 covenant |
| Total deposit | Initial BCH deposit amount |
| Public | Whether the vault appears in the public explorer |

Three signers and three public keys are required. The on-chain vault covenant enforces that any payout requires at minimum 2-of-3 signatures.

## Funding a Vault

After creation, the dashboard shows a **Deposit** button. The first deposit must include the state NFT (built automatically by the app). Subsequent deposits are plain P2SH sends to the vault contract address.

## Vault Roles

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| Creator | Create and fund the vault, create proposals, pause/cancel products |
| Signer | Approve and co-sign proposals |
| Viewer | Read-only access to public vault data |

## Linked Products

Any stream, payment, airdrop, or grant can be linked to a vault by selecting it in the creation form. This surfaces the product in the vault's detail view and uses the vault's `vaultId` in the covenant's constructor parameters, allowing future governance proposals to control the contract.
