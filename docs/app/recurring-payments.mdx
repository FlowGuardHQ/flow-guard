Recurring payments automate fixed-amount payroll, subscriptions, or retainer agreements on BCH. Funds are locked in a covenant and released each interval — no custodian required.

## Creating a Payment

Navigate to **Payments → New Payment** and fill in:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Recipient | BCH P2PKH address |
| Amount per period | BCH or token amount per interval |
| Interval | Daily, Weekly, Biweekly, Monthly, or Yearly |
| Start date | Unix timestamp when first payment becomes claimable |
| End date | Optional cutoff date |
| Cancelable | Whether the sender can reclaim remaining funds |
| Pausable | Whether the sender can pause disbursements |

The contract is funded with **12 periods upfront**. If the sender wants to extend, they can top up the contract directly.

## Claiming a Payment

Recipients can claim all overdue intervals in a single transaction. The contract verifies `current_time >= next_payment_time` and releases the correct number of intervals.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the payment">
    Click on the payment in your **Receiving** tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Claim">
    Click **Claim**. The app calculates how many intervals are due and builds a single claim transaction.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">
    Sign in your wallet. The `confirm-claim` call updates `total_paid` and schedules the next payment date.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Pausing and Resuming

The sender can pause a payment (e.g. during a contract dispute). While paused, no new intervals become claimable. Resuming resets `next_payment_date` to `now + interval`.

## Cancelling

Cancel returns all unfunded period balances to the sender's address. Already-due periods at the time of cancellation are still claimable by the recipient.
