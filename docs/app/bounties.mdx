Bounties are milestone-based budget plans scoped to a single deliverable. The funder locks BCH or tokens in a covenant. The bounty hunter completes the task and claims the release once the time lock elapses and the funder confirms the work.

## Creating a Bounty

Navigate to **Bounties → New Bounty** and specify:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Title | What needs to be built or done |
| Recipient | BCH address of the bounty hunter |
| Vault | Funding vault |
| Amount | Total payout in BCH or tokens |
| Duration | How many seconds after funding the payout unlocks |
| Cancelable | Whether the funder can cancel if work is unacceptable |

The bounty becomes a single-milestone budget plan under the hood. The recipient can release the full amount after the duration elapses.

## Claiming a Bounty

When the lock period elapses, the bounty hunter navigates to the bounty and clicks **Release**. No intermediary is involved — the covenant enforces the time condition directly.

## Cancelling

If the funder set `cancelable: true` and the work was not completed satisfactorily, they can cancel before the recipient releases. Cancelled funds return to the vault controller address.
